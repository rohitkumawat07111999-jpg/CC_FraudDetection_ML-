# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project involves detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing a Kaggle dataset with 284,807 rows and 31 features. The goal is to classify transactions accurately using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Key Features

    Data Analysis: Explored and preprocessed a large dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
    Class Imbalance Handling: Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and other sampling methods to address class imbalance and improve model performance.
    Model Implementation: Developed and evaluated several classification models, including Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
    Performance Metrics: Assessed model effectiveness using precision, recall, and F1-score, with Logistic Regression showing superior performance and robust fraud detection         capabilities.

## Technologies Used

    Data Processing: Python, Pandas, NumPy
    Visualization: Matplotlib
    Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
    Class Imbalance Handling: SMOTE
